# **Emulation of Guitar Effects Using AI**

**Overview**

This project aims to emulate guitar effects using deep learning, leveraging the WaveNet model to process audio data and generate guitar effects in real time. By training a neural network to learn the transformations applied by various guitar effects, this project seeks to recreate the nuanced sound modifications applied by traditional guitar pedals and audio processors.

## **Methodology and Key Technologies**

**Model: WaveNet**
- WaveNet Architecture: WaveNet uses dilated causal convolutions, allowing the model to capture long-range dependencies within the audio waveform. This architecture is particularly well-suited for emulating audio effects as it enables the model to learn intricate audio patterns that mimic how guitar effects process sound.

- Input and Output: The model is trained by providing clean guitar sound data as input, while the output is the sound with the guitar effect applied. Through this structure, the model learns to approximate the transformation from clean to effected sound.

- Audio Pattern Learning: By utilizing dilated convolutions, WaveNet can learn a wide range of audio patterns at different temporal resolutions, which is critical in capturing the subtleties of various audio effects.

**Frameworks**

- PyTorch: PyTorch is used to design, train, and experiment with the WaveNet model. Its flexibility and dynamic computation graph make it ideal for this research, allowing rapid prototyping and testing of the model architecture.

- TensorFlow: TensorFlow is used for handling large-scale models and deployment needs. Once trained in PyTorch, the model can be ported to TensorFlow for broader deployment and integration with JUCE for real-time applications.

**Additional Components**

- JUCE Integration: An important goal of this project is to integrate the trained WaveNet model with the JUCE framework. JUCE provides powerful tools for creating real-time audio applications, allowing for the real-time monitoring of guitar effect emulation and enabling real-time interaction with the model as an effect processor.

## **Usage**

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.8 or later
- PyTorch and TensorFlow (installation instructions provided below)
- JUCE Framework (for real-time audio processing, optional for testing)

**Installation**

To set up the environment:
```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wavenet-guitar-effects
cd wavenet-guitar-effects

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Training the Model**

The model can be trained using your dataset of clean and effect-applied guitar audio files:
```
python train.py --data_path /path/to/your/data
```

**Evaluating and Testing**

After training, you can evaluate the model with test audio files to measure performance metrics like loss and SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio):

```
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/model.pth --test_data /path/to/test/data
```

**JUCE Integration**

Integrating with JUCE allows real-time monitoring and deployment of the trained model for real-time guitar processing. This integration can be set up with instructions from the JUCE documentation.

## **Future Goals**
- Extended Effects Range: Training additional models to cover a broader range of guitar effects (e.g., distortion, reverb, delay).
- Real-Time Optimization: Further optimizing the model for reduced latency in real-time applications.
- Platform Deployment: Packaging the emulated effects as standalone plugins or applications for musicians.
